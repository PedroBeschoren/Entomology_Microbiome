# Entomology_Microbiome v 0.1

### This repository focuses on microbiome analysis in R 

**Target audience**: Phd students, master students and postdocs of the Entomology Department of Wageningen University. 

**Contents**: The scripts includes preprocessing (removing contaminants, normalizing), some basics in analysis (such as alpha and beta diversity analysis), and also advanced tools (netowrk analysis and random forest). Each section will also include custom functions to automate the process, and where applicable, loops to execute the analysis on different data slices. goodbye repetitive code!

**Requirements**: Basic familiarity with R is necessary. we will use tools that help organizing code such as R Markdown, GitHub version control, and good coding practices. Also, not all jargon will be explained in detail: are you confused about the difference between OTUs (Operetional taxonomic unit) and ASVs (amplicon sequencing variant)? Ask your colleagues, the manuals of the software you are using, specialized literature, and google.

**License**: These scripts are free to be downloaded, copied and edited. simply mention  this github page as a reference. there is no associated guarantee.
